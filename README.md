# * How to install and run the project: No third party used to install
    * Nothing special just download the code and open BirthdaysList.xcodeproj file and hit run
     

    
## I have decided to use SwiftUI with Combine for this assignment Its easy to implement the UI and combine making all the stuff when its coming to binding data between ViewModel and the View.

## I used MVVM architecture 

## If I had more time I would go with Modular architecture with diferrent dynamic frameworks handling the remote and local data source in (Data layer) , handling all views and custom view in (Presentation layer) , handilng the binding between Data layer and Presentation layer into (Domain layer) and Main Layer of the app which is responsible for running the main app view and handling navigations like Coordinators.
